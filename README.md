# Donimo, a CTA Rail Bot

Domino helps give arrival times for all CTA stations through discord's slash commands and interactions.

### How to run
To self-host this bot, you would need a Discord API Key and a CTA API Key respectively. These will be placed in a **.env** file to be read in the python script. **NOTE:** CTA API handles 10k requests per day for free
### Further plans
- Recommended places around the station
- Bus route arrival times
- "prettify" message/embeds
- be able to handle over 10k requests to CTA API
